# Flutter-Co-Performance-Analysis
This dashboard was created using Microsoft Excel to analyze and visualize the annual performance of Flutter Co. for the year 2019. It is a well-structured, interactive dashboard that provides critical insights into sales performance, top-performing cities, product categories, sales representatives, and monthly revenue trends.

The goal of this project was to transform raw sales data into a visually engaging and insightful report that helps stakeholders identify key growth areas, track achievements, and recognize performance gaps across different dimensions.

## Observations:
1. Sales peaked in December, likely due to holiday demand. A marketing boost in Q4 could maximize this pattern.
2. Three cities (New York, Portland, and Miami) accounted for a large share of revenue and shipments — these are strategic markets.
3. Low average transaction values suggest most customers purchase in small quantities; this may affect logistics and profit margins.
4. The Beverages category outperformed all others, showing clear consumer preference and product strength.
5. Certain sales reps are underperforming compared to top achievers, indicating either regional market differences or training gaps.

## Recommendations:

1. Focus on High-Performing Cities:
 Increase investments in marketing, distribution, and sales support in New York, Portland, and Miami to strengthen dominance.
2. Upsell and Bundle Products:
Develop strategies to increase the average transaction value. For example, offer bundles or volume discounts.
3. Replicate Nancy Freehafer’s Strategy:
Analyze her sales approach and replicate it across underperforming reps through mentorship or training.
4. Boost Mid-Year Sales:
Sales in months like February, July, and October are below average. Launch promotional campaigns or limited-time offers in these periods.
5. Expand High-Growth Categories:
Given the outstanding performance of Beverages and Sauces, consider expanding these product lines or introducing premium versions.
6. Explore Corporate Sales:
To reduce small-ticket transactions, consider targeting corporate or wholesale clients for larger order volumes.
